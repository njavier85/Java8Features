if there is an anonymous maybe we can use a lambda expression

anonymous inner class
class without a name

if the interface has only 1 abstract method we can use lambda expression
anonymous inner class can extends abstract classes and concrete classes
anonymous inner class can implements interfaces with many abstract methods
anonymous inner class is more power full

in lambda expression is not possible to declare instance variable, always refeer to
outer class variable
